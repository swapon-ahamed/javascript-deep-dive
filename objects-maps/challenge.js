// Challenge:
// 1. Create three variables - bar, cafe, restaurant - and set their values to a bar, a cafe and a restaurant in your city
// 2. Create an object - favouritePlaces - and populate it with your variables from task 1
// 3. If you're not already using the object property shorthand, refactor your code to do so
// 4. Create a method on the object - greeting() -  that logs out a message to the console
// 5. Invoke the greeting() method and also log out your favourite restaurant to the console

const bar = "bar";
const cafe = "cafe";
const restaurant = "restaurant";

const favouritePlaces = { bar, cafe, restaurant, greeting(){console.log(this.restaurant) } };

favouritePlaces.greeting();
